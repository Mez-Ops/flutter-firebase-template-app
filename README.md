# Mez Ops Flutter App Template

This is meant to be a simple code space where Flutter has been setup and configured. 

Below are some instructions on creating your first Flutter app.

I will be using flutter web apps primarily, but you can use this template for mobile apps as well.

# Getting Started

This will walk you through setting up your first Flutter app.

## Understanding how this template works.

First, watch this video:

or go through this tutorial:

https://dev.to/pwd9000/hosting-your-self-hosted-runners-on-github-codespaces-2elc

Note: you will need to follow along with this repo. There will be some steps where you need
to create 3 secrets in the repo using a GitHub personal access token. 

## Firebase setup

In order to push your app to hosting, you will need to
setup a firebase app first. We will do this in the console
below. You should have at least set up a Firebase account here:

https://console.firebase.google.com/

Once you have an account, you can create a new project.
